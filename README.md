# CarPredictor
A Dense Neural Network to predict the price of a car given a few key specs.

This project uses Tensorflow for its Neural Network and Flask for the UI/webpage.

The webpage can be found [here].

This project is intended as a learning tool and demonstration of various valuable skills.

Thanks to u/nicolas-gervais for providing the [dataset](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/b6rcwv/i_scraped_32000_cars_including_the_price_and_115/) I used.
